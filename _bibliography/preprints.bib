	abstract = {Several neuroimaging studies have investigated localized aberrations in brain structure, function or connectivity in late-life depression, but the ensuing results are equivocal and often conflicting. Here, we provide a quantitative consolidation of neuroimaging in late-life depression using coordinate-based meta-analysis by searching multiple databases and tracing the relevant references up to March 2020. Our search revealed 3252 unique records, among which we identified 32 eligible whole-brain neuroimaging publications comparing 674 late-life depression patients with 568 healthy controls. The peak coordinates of group comparisons between patients and controls were extracted and then analyzed using activation likelihood estimation method. Our sufficiently powered analysis on all the experiments, and more homogenous subsections of the data (in-/decreases, experiments using functional imaging) revealed no significant convergent regional abnormality in late-life depression. This inconsistency might be due to experimental (e.g., choice of tasks, image modalities) and analytic flexibility (e.g., preprocessing and analytic parameters), distributed patterns of neural abnormalities, and heterogeneity of clinical populations (e.g., severity of late-life depression, age of onset). Our findings highlight the need for more reproducible research by using pre-registered and standardized protocols on more homogenous populations to identify potential consistent brain abnormalities in late-life depression.},
