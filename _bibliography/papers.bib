	abstract = {<b>Background:</b> Red blood cell distribution width ({RDW}) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of circulating erythrocytes.
It has been recently identified as a prognostic marker in several diseases including acute pancreatitis ({AP}). In this systematic
review the prognostic value of {RDW} in predicting mortality of {AP} patients will be assessed.
<br>
<b>Methods:</b> {PubMed}, Scopus, {EMBASE}, and {ISI} databases were searched until September 2016 using the following search strategy:
(pancreatitis {OR} pancreatitides) {AND} ({RDW} {OR} "red cell distribution width" {OR} "red blood cell distribution width" {OR} anisocytosis).
Four authors independently reviewed the retrieved articles. Studies were included if they had evaluated the association between {RDW}
value and mortality of acute pancreatitis patients. Case reports, comments, letters to the editor, reviews, study protocols, and experimental
studies were not included. Data abstraction and quality assessment for the included studies was independently performed by
two authors. Quality of studies was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist for prognostic studies. Data
were synthesized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis was performed on the diagnostic performance of {RDW} to predict mortality in {AP}
patients.
<br>
<b>Results:</b> Seven studies (976 patients) were included in the systematic review. Six studies reported a statistically significant association
between {RDW} value and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed on four studies (487 patients) using a bivariate model and a
summary receiver operating characteristic ({sROC}) curve was plotted with an area under the curve ({AUC}) of 0.757. The pooled diagnostic
odds ratio ({DOR}), sensitivity and specificity was 19.51 (95\% {CI}: 5.26-72.30), 67\% (95\% {CI}: 51\%-80\%) and 90\% (95\% {CI}:
73\%-96\%), respectively.
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> {RDW} is an easy to use and an inexpensive marker with a moderate prognostic value to predict death in {AP} patients.
Clinicians should be more alert when a patient with {AP} has an increased {RDW}. Investigation of possible combinations of other prognostic
markers with {RDW} is recommended.},
