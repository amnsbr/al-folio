I have received my M.D. from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, and I'm currently working as a non-resident researcher in Institute of Medical Science and Technology at Shahid Beheshti University, doing neuroimaging research under the supervision of <a href="http://en.sbu.ac.ir/Research_Institutes/MedicalSci/Pages/Dr.-Masoud-Tahmasian.aspx">Dr. Masoud Tahmasian</a>.

I use coordinate-based meta-analysis and functional and structural neuroimaging methods to better understand the brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and multiple sclerosis, as well as the normal functioning of human brain in e.g. nociception and motor learning. I am also interested in developing and testing new methods for analyzing neuroimaging data. Ultimately, I am developing my skills in computational neuroscience and machine learning, gearing more toward model-driven research, as opposed to exploratory neuroimaging analyses.

In my spare time, I enjoy programming and building small web/desktop applications, cooking, playing video games, and watching TV shows.
