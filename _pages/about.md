I have an M.D. from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, and I'm doing neuroimaging research in Institute of Medical Science and Technology at Shahid Beheshti University, under the supervision of Dr. Masoud Tahmasian.

Currently, I am using coordinate-based meta-analysis, in addition to functional and structural MRI methods to better understand the brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and multiple sclerosis, as well as the function of normal human brain in e.g. nociception and motor learning. I am also interested in developing and testing new methods of neuroimaging data analysis. In addition, I am developing my skills in computational neuroscience methods, to be able to do more model-driven research, as compared to exploratory neuroimaging analyses.
