I've been interested in neuroscience, since high school and from before I started the medical school, and I went into medical school specifically to become a neuroscientist. Down the way, after studying a couple of general neuroscience books (such as Bear's"Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain"), I was introduced to the field of computational neuroscience, by the book "From Computer to Brain: Foundations of Computational Neuroscience", and realized that I can better understand the brain in this context. Therefore, I self-taught myself a variety of mathematical and computational skills, in addition to Python programming, using different books and online courses, which was a challenging, yet rewarding experience. My progress in computational neuroscience slowed down upon entering the more difficult clinical years of medical school. But just before graduating, I was lucky enough to meet Dr. Masoud Tahmasian, and realize that neuroimaging offers everything that I'm looking for, at the intersection of my interests in mathematics and computational techniques, neuroscience, technology, and doing clinically useful research.
