#### Neuroimaging and clinical systematic review and meta-analysis
I was first introduced to systematic reviews and meta-analyses by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N83DJ5oAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ramin Sadeghi</a>, who was a systematic review expert in our university. With practice, and by performing a couple of published/unpublished meta-analyses, I gained a high level of confidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. I also developed a small web application to find topics that are eligible for a systematic review and I'm still thinking about ways of automating different stages of these studies. My first exposure to neuroimaging meta-analyses was by a workshop taught by Prof. Simon Eickhoff, who is one of the authorities in this field. After this workshop, I started my very first neuroimaging project as an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on late-life depression, from which I learned a lot. Now, I think I am fully capable of planning and performing coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses.

#### Structural neuroimaging analyses
For investigating on the structural correlates of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis, I have worked with different neuroimaging packages, including FSL-VBM, SPM, SPM-CAT, and FreeSurfer. In addition, I have used FSL-FIRST to investigate thalamic shape abnormalities in these patients. As a result, I am fairly confident with performing basic structural neuroimaging analyses using FSL, although my SPM and FreeSurfer skills need more development.

#### Analysis of task-based and resting-state fMRI data
I had a lot of great experience working with t-fMRI data while studying the neural correlates of vicarious facilitation of painful stimuli. In this project, I used fMRIprep for the preprocessing, which was really interesting, and required conversion of the dataset into BIDS format, for which I used Python. I also am comfortable with using FSL FEAT for preprocessing, and have practiced with it using FSL Course data. After preprocessing, I used FSL FEAT for performing GLM analysis and extracting trial-by-trial beta series of BOLD response to painful stimuli for each subject. Finally, I used Tor Wager's Mediation Toolbox to investigate which brain regions mediate the increased pain rating in response to emotional faces. For learning the analysis of t-fMRI data, I have used Poldrack's <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-of-functional-mri-data-analysis/8EDF966C65811FCCC306F7C916228529">"Handbook of Functional MRI Data Analysis"</a>, Mumford's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7gF0zm35FwrFpDND6DWeA">youtube channel</a>, and FSL Course.

As for rs-fMRI analyses, so far I have had no hands-on real experience with it in my research. However, I have read the book <a href="http://www.neuroimagingprimers.org/list-of-primers/">"Introduction to Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity"</a>, which was really great and I have done its exercises which involved using FSL in analyzing rs-fMRI data.

#### Programming
I am fully confident with using Python in analyzing data, as well as building web and desktop applications. You can see some of my published Python projects in <a href="https://github.com/amnsbr">my github account</a>. I am also learning how to use nipype and nilearn to analyze neuroimaging data with Python. I also have some experience with R (particularly with clinical meta-analyses) and MATLAB, but my skills in these two are a bit shaky.

#### Statistics
I am familiar with most of the common descriptive and analytical statistical procedures, and can perform and interpret them using Python (with Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and Statsmodels) and SPSS.

#### Machine learning
I have attended several courses on machine learning and I'm comfortable with most of the basic concepts. I can use Tensorflow, PyTorch and Scikit-learn to do simple vanilla machine learning procedures. But I'm looking forward to learning more about machine learning, to be able to use it on neuroimaging data.
