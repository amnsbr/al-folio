#### Neuroimaging and clinical systematic review and meta-analysis
All of my first real research experiences involved using systematic reviews and meta-analyses. My first introduction to systematic reviews was by a workshop taught by Dr. Ramin Sadeghi, who is one of the systematic review gurus in Iran. With practice, and by doing a couple of meta-analyses (some resulting in publication and some not), I mastered the skills required for doing systematic reviews as well as meta-analyses. I also developed a small web application to find topics that are eligible for a systematic review. After doing a couple of meta-analyses with clinical questions, I participated in a workshop on neuroimaging meta-analyses taught by Prof. Simon Eickhoff, and then geared toward neuroimaging meta-analyses and performed my very first neuroimaging project on the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on late-life depression. I know consider myself fully capable of planning, managing, and performing coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses.

#### Analyzing structural neuroimaging data
I have used different neuroimaging packages, including FSL-VBM, SPM, SPM-CAT, and FreeSurfer to analyze structural neuroimaging data of patients with multiple sclerosis, and compare the GM density, or cortical thickness between patients with and without fatigue. In addition, I have used FSL-FIRST to investigate thalamic shape abnormalities in these patients. I am fairly confident with using FSL, but my SPM and FreeSurfer skills are a bit shaky, and need more development.

#### Analyzing task-based fMRI data
I had a lot of great experience working with t-fMRI data in my project on neural correlates of vicarious facilitation of painful stimuli. For preprocessing I have used fMRIprep, which was really interesting, and before that, I had to convert the dataset into BIDS format using a Python script. Next, I used FSL FEAT for performing GLM analysis and extracting trial-by-trial beta series of BOLD response to painful stimuli for each subject. Finally, I used Tor Wager's Mediation Toolbox to investigate which brain regions mediate the increased pain rating in response to seeing emotional faces.

#### Analyzing resting-state fMRI data
So far I have had no hands-on real experience with using rs-fMRI in my research. However, I have read the book <a href="http://www.neuroimagingprimers.org/list-of-primers/">"Introduction to Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity"</a>, which was really great and had some exercises for working with real rs-fMRI data using FSL.

#### Programming
I am fully confident with using Python in data science and research, as well as building web and desktop applications. You can see some of my published Python projects in this page. I am also learning how to use nipype and nilearn to analyze neuroimagin data via Python. I also have some experience with R (particularly with clinical meta-analyses) and MATLAB, but Python is the language that I love the most.

#### Statistics
I am familiar with most of the common descriptive and analytical statistical procedures, and can perform and interpret them using SPSS, Python (with Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and Statsmodels) and a little bit R.

#### Machine learning
I have attended several courses on machine learning and I'm comfortable with most of the basic concepts. I can use Tensorflow, PyTorch and Scikit-learn to do simple vanilla machine learning procedures. But I'm looking forward to learning more about machine learning, and specifically its usage in neuroimaging.
