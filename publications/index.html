      <p>BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in infants with confirmed COVID-19 infection by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8%), consolidation (28.57%), nodule (18.57%), effusion (7.14%) and focal lucency (7.14%).
CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants’ chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group. Other chest CT scan manifestations can be classified as typical COVID-19 infection (peripheral GGO), lobar pneumonia (consolidation) and opportunistic infections (pulmonary nodules).</p>

      <p>Neuroimaging and genetics studies have advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of sleep and its disorders. However, individual studies usually have limitations to identifying consistent and reproducible effects, including modest sample sizes, heterogeneous clinical characteristics and varied methodologies. These issues call for a large-scale multi-centre effort in sleep research, in order to increase the number of samples, and harmonize the methods of data collection, preprocessing and analysis using pre-registered well-established protocols. The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium provides a powerful collaborative framework for combining datasets across individual sites. Recently, we have launched the ENIGMA-Sleep working group with the collaboration of several institutes from 15 countries to perform large-scale worldwide neuroimaging and genetics studies for better understanding the neurobiology of impaired sleep quality in population-based healthy individuals, the neural consequences of sleep deprivation, pathophysiology of sleep disorders, as well as neural correlates of sleep disturbances across various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this introductory review, we describe the details of our currently available datasets and our ongoing projects in the ENIGMA-Sleep group, and discuss both the potential challenges and opportunities of a collaborative initiative in sleep medicine.</p>

      <p>Thalamus plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis-related fatigue (MSrF). However, the thalamus is a heterogeneous structure and the specific thalamic subregions that are involved in this condition are unclear. Here, we used thalamic shape analysis for the detailed localization of thalamic abnormalities in MSrF. Using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, we measured fatigue in 42 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The thalamic shape was extracted from T1w images using an automated pipeline. We investigated the association of thalamic surface deviations with the severity of global fatigue and its cognitive, physical and psychosocial subdomains. Cognitive fatigue was correlated with an inward deformity of the left anteromedial thalamic surface, but no other localized shape deviation was observed in correlation with global, physical or psychosocial fatigue. Our findings indicate that the left anteromedial thalamic subregions are implicated in cognitive fatigue, possibly through their role in reward processing and cognitive and executive functions.</p>

      <p>Background: Inflammatory processes have been proposed in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL 1 beta (IL-1β), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) with the prognosis and functional outcome in patients with less severe ischemic stroke., 
Methods: We measured the level of IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α on days 1 and 5 after stroke onset by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The infarct volume was assessed using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and posterior circulation ASPECTS (pcASPECTS) score in brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The severity of stroke was assessed by applying the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) in 24 hours on day 5 and after 3 months from stroke onset. Good outcome was defined as the third month MRS ≤ 2. The association of inflammatory markers and the course of stroke symptoms over time was examined., 
Results: Forty-four first-ever stroke patients without concurrent inflammatory diseases with a mean age of 65 years were included. The mean NIHSS and MRS in admission time were 6.5 ± 3.5 and 3.07, respectively. The day 1 and the day 5 levels of IL-1β, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α were not significantly different in good and poor outcome groups (all P-values \textgreater 0.05). In addition, they were not significantly associated with the ASPECTS, pcASPECTS, and changes of NIHSS and MRS over time., 
Conclusion: The levels of hsCRP, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are not reliable predictors of functional outcomes in patients with less severe acute ischemic stroke (AIS).</p>

      <p><b>Background:</b> Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of circulating erythrocytes.
It has been recently identified as a prognostic marker in several diseases including acute pancreatitis (AP). In this systematic
review the prognostic value of RDW in predicting mortality of AP patients will be assessed.
<br />
<b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and ISI databases were searched until September 2016 using the following search strategy:
(pancreatitis OR pancreatitides) AND (RDW OR "red cell distribution width" OR "red blood cell distribution width" OR anisocytosis).
Four authors independently reviewed the retrieved articles. Studies were included if they had evaluated the association between RDW
value and mortality of acute pancreatitis patients. Case reports, comments, letters to the editor, reviews, study protocols, and experimental
studies were not included. Data abstraction and quality assessment for the included studies was independently performed by
two authors. Quality of studies was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist for prognostic studies. Data
were synthesized qualitatively, and a meta-analysis was performed on the diagnostic performance of RDW to predict mortality in AP
patients.
<br />
<b>Results:</b> Seven studies (976 patients) were included in the systematic review. Six studies reported a statistically significant association
between RDW value and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed on four studies (487 patients) using a bivariate model and a
summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve was plotted with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.757. The pooled diagnostic
odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity and specificity was 19.51 (95% CI: 5.26-72.30), 67% (95% CI: 51%-80%) and 90% (95% CI:
73%-96%), respectively.
<br />
<b>Conclusion:</b> RDW is an easy to use and an inexpensive marker with a moderate prognostic value to predict death in AP patients.
Clinicians should be more alert when a patient with AP has an increased RDW. Investigation of possible combinations of other prognostic
markers with RDW is recommended.</p>

      <p>INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have reported brain alterations in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, they pointed to inconsistent findings. 
METHODS: We used a meta-analytic approach to identify the convergent structural and functional brain abnormalities in bvFTD. Following the best-practice neuroimaging meta-analysis guidelines, we searched PubMed and Embase databases and performed reference tracking. Then, the coordinates of group comparisons between bvFTD and controls from 73 studies were extracted and tested for convergence using activation likelihood estimation. 
RESULTS: We identified convergent abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortices, anterior insula, amygdala, paracingulate, striatum, and hippocampus. Task-based and resting-state functional connectivity pointed to the joint networks that are connected to the obtained consistent regions. Functional decoding analyses suggested associated dysfunction of emotional processing, interoception, reward processing, higher-order cognitive functions, olfactory and gustatory perceptions in bvFTD.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted a key role of the salience network and subcortical regions in the pathophysiology of bvFTD.</p>

      <p>Several neuroimaging studies have investigated localized aberrations in brain structure, function or connectivity in late-life depression, but the ensuing results are equivocal and often conflicting. Here, we provide a quantitative consolidation of neuroimaging in late-life depression using coordinate-based meta-analysis by searching multiple databases and tracing the relevant references up to March 2020. Our search revealed 3252 unique records, among which we identified 32 eligible whole-brain neuroimaging publications comparing 674 late-life depression patients with 568 healthy controls. The peak coordinates of group comparisons between patients and controls were extracted and then analyzed using activation likelihood estimation method. Our sufficiently powered analysis on all the experiments, and more homogenous subsections of the data (in-/decreases, experiments using functional imaging) revealed no significant convergent regional abnormality in late-life depression. This inconsistency might be due to experimental (e.g., choice of tasks, image modalities) and analytic flexibility (e.g., preprocessing and analytic parameters), distributed patterns of neural abnormalities, and heterogeneity of clinical populations (e.g., severity of late-life depression, age of onset). Our findings highlight the need for more reproducible research by using pre-registered and standardized protocols on more homogenous populations to identify potential consistent brain abnormalities in late-life depression.</p>

      <p>Introduction: The response to noxious stimuli can be facilitated by observing another person in pain [1]. This effect has been suggested to result from a sensorimotor resonance through the mirror neurons, or an increased level of arousal [2,3]. In this study, we used mediation effect parametric mapping (MEPM) to understand which regions of the brain mediate this effect. Method: We scanned 21 pain-free volunteers (10 females; mean age = 25.2±4.1) using fMRI while performing a vicarious pain facilitation paradigm. In each trial (N=24) participants observed neutral, fearful, or painful facial expressions, before receiving a shock that elicited the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR), an objective indicative of nociceptive processing in the spinal cord and recorded their subjective pain ratings. We used multi-level MEPM to test the mediation effect of trial-by-trial voxel-wise brain activity in response to shocks for the relationship between the emotional valence of the observed facial expressions and pain ratings or NFR responses, after FDR correction (p&lt;0.05, k=10). Results: The inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, paracentral lobule, cerebellum, and anterior cingulate cortex were significant mediators of vicarious facilitation of pain after observing both fearful and painful facial expressions. With the painful facial expressions, more widespread regions of the brain mediated this effect, additionally including precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, the temporoparietal junction, superior parietal lobule, insula and thalamus. The increase in NFR after observing painful facial expressions was mediated by the putamen and superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions: The vicarious facilitation of pain is mediated by regions that are part of the human motor neuron system, or are involved in affective theory of mind, in addition to the regions involved in the emotional modulation of pain.</p>

      <p>Late life depression (LLD) is turning into a health concern with the aging of the population. Its unique presentation with somatic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction highlights the need to study LLD as a distinct disease process from depression in younger adults. Numerous functional and structural neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of LLD, but have reported inconsistent results. In this study, we aimed to identify locations in the brain that were most consistently altered across the existing studies.Method We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge for relevant studies published until July 2019 and retrieved 2657 potential studies. All whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comparing patients with LLD and healthy controls (HC) were included. Two authors independently extracted the data and the peak coordinates of the significant foci. Coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed using the revised activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method according to the current best-practice guidelines.Results We identified 23 eligible studies (eight VBM, one PET, five resting-state fMRI, and ten task-based fMRI) including 516 LLD patients and 490 HCs. No significant converging structural and functional brain abnormalities between LLD and HC (27 experiments) was observed after controlling for multiple comparisons using a stringent cluster-level family-wise error correction (pcFWE = 0.680). Additionally, the meta-analysis on LLD &gt; HC with 13 experiments (pcFWE = 0.069) and LLD &lt; HC with 14 experiments (pcFWE = 0.357) revealed no significant convergent abnormalities.Conclusions The lack of convergence across individual studies might be related to the differences in experimental designs and statistical approaches, heterogeneity of clinical populations, and small sample sizes of the individual studies. Currently, there is not enough evidence available to pinpoint a specific underlying neural pathology associated with LLD.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction:</b> Glioblastoma multiforem (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and it is important to identify biomarkers that can predict its prognosis. The aim of this study was to systematically review the prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with GBM.<br /> <b>Materials and Methods:</b> PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched until February 2016 using the following search strategy: neutrophil* AND lymphocyte* AND (glioma OR glioblastoma OR astrocytoma).  Two authors independently screened the retrieved articles to find all the studies that evaluated the prognostic value of NLR in GBM patients. Data extraction and quality assessment for the included studies was performed independently by two authors. Studies using Cox proportional hazards model to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with low and high values of NLR were included in the meta-analysis.<br /> <b>Results:</b> Six studies and 827 patients were included in the systematic review. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary outcome in two studies. One study identified lower values of NLR as a significant predictor of better PFS, but the other one showed the opposite effect. Performing a meta-analysis was not possible on these two studies. The primary outcome in six studies was OS, four of which reported NLR as a significant prognostic marker. Pooled univariate hazard ratios (HRs) of two studies for predicting OS was 1.903 (95% CI: 1.420-2.551) and pooled multivariate HRs of four studies for predicting OS was 1.564 (95% CI: 1.208-2.024). Negligible heterogeneity was observed between studies.<br /> <b>Conclusion:</b> Overall survival of GBM patients can be predicted using NLR, but its application as a predictive marker of PFS is uncertain. </p>

      <p><b>Context:</b> Bevacizumab is an FDA approved antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Patients have varied response to this treatment and it is important to identify biomarkers that can predict responders.<br /> <b>Objective:</b> To systematically review the prognostic value of cerebral blood volume (CBV) in glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab.<br /> <b>Data sources:</b> PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched until March 2016 using the following search strategy: “glioblastoma AND bevacizumab AND (‘cerebral blood volume’ OR ‘relative blood volume’ OR CBV OR rCBV or RBV)”.<br /> <b>Study Selection:</b> Two authors independently reviewed the retrieved articles. All studies that evaluated the prognostic value of cerebral blood volume in glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab were included. Case reports, letters to editor and review articles were excluded.<br /> <b>Data Extraction:</b> Data extraction for included studies was performed independently by two authors. Quality of studies was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist for prognostic studies.<br /> <b>Results:</b> Eight studies (303 patients) were included. In six studies all the patients had recurrent glioblastoma and in one study patients with grade III glioma were included as well. OS and PFS were the outcomes of interest in 7 and 8 studies, respectively. To evaluate the prognostic value of cerebral blood volume, six studies performed log-rank survival analysis and five studies used univariate or multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, three of which reported hazard ratios. Cerebral blood volume was reported as a significant predictor of OS and PFS in 4 studies (173 patients).<br /> <b>Conclusions:</b> The conflicting results of included studies indicate that the application of cerebral blood volume as a prognostic factor in glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab is uncertain. We suggest performing a meta-analysis to further explore this prognostic role.</p>

      <p>Stress affects working memory based on plenty of evidences and in most cases its effect is impairing. It seems that severity of this effect depends on multiple factors. One of the possible factors may be personality traits. Current study is designed to examine probable vulnerability of some personality traits to the effect of social stress on working memory. In this study, performance of individuals in working memory test will be compared before and after the treatment with Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Individuals’ personality will be evaluated based on NEO-FFI (NEO-Five Factor Inventory). Salivary Cortisol levels will be measured before and after the treatment as a marker of HPAA (Hypothalamic-Pituatury-Adrenal axis) activity. Finally, we will analyze the correlation between data obtained from working memory test and NEO-FFI.</p>
